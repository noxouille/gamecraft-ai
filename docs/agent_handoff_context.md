## Current Project Phase/Milestone

**Phase:** Project Initialization and Foundation Setup
**Milestone:** MVP Development (Week 1-2 of 8-week timeline)
**Current Focus:** Query classification and routing system foundation

### Project Overview
GameCraft AI is an AI-powered web application that helps YouTube gaming content creators by providing two core functionalities:
1. **Event Coverage**: Transform long-form gaming events into structured summaries and production-ready scripts
2. **Game Reviews/Videos**: Generate comprehensive video scripts about individual games with trailer compilation and key information gathering

The platform supports both English and French languages with automatic language detection.

### Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Query Type Classification System**
   - Implement language detection (English/French)
   - Build query classifier to distinguish between event and game queries
   - Create routing logic for dual-mode processing

2. **Core Architecture Setup**
   - Design modular agent system architecture
   - Implement base classes for different agent types
   - Set up configuration management for LLM models
   - Create database schema and connection layer

3. **External API Integration Foundation**
   - Research and document API requirements (YouTube, Steam, IGDB, etc.)
   - Implement API client base classes
   - Set up authentication and rate limiting frameworks

## Required Deliverables

### Technical Deliverables
- [ ] Query classification service (`src/gamecraft_ai/services/query_classifier.py`)
- [ ] Base agent architecture (`src/gamecraft_ai/agents/base_agent.py`)
- [ ] Database models and schema (`src/gamecraft_ai/models/`)
- [ ] API client framework (`src/gamecraft_ai/clients/`)
- [ ] Configuration management system (`src/gamecraft_ai/config.py` enhancement)
- [ ] FastAPI endpoints for query processing (`/classify`, `/process`)

### Documentation Deliverables
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] API integration research document
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Agent system design document

### Testing Deliverables
- [ ] Unit tests for query classification
- [ ] Integration tests for API clients
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for classification speed (<500ms requirement)

---

## Technical Constraints and Dependencies

### Hard Constraints
- Python 3.12+ (as specified in pyproject.toml)
- FastAPI framework (already established)
- Query classification must be <500ms
- Support for concurrent requests (target: 10)
- Bilingual support (English/French)

### External Dependencies to Research
- **Required APIs:**
  - YouTube Data API v3 (for video analysis and media discovery)
  - Steam Web API (game information)
  - IGDB API (comprehensive game database)
  - OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (LLM processing)
  - Whisper API (video transcription)

- **Infrastructure Dependencies:**
  - Redis (caching layer)
  - PostgreSQL (data storage)
  - Rate limiting middleware

### Performance Requirements
- Query classification: <500ms
- Total processing time: <60 seconds for game content, <5 minutes for events
- Information accuracy: >95% for game details
- Concurrent request handling: 10 users

## Open Questions/Blockers

### API Access Questions
1. **API Rate Limits:** What are the specific rate limits for each external API?
2. **API Costs:** Need cost analysis for expected usage volumes
3. **API Authentication:** How to securely manage multiple API keys?

### Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **Agent Communication:** How should agents pass data between each other?
2. **Caching Strategy:** What data should be cached and for how long?
3. **Error Handling:** How to handle external API failures gracefully?
4. **Scaling:** Database design for future horizontal scaling?

### Technical Clarifications
1. **LLM Model Selection:** Confirm specific models for each agent type
2. **Language Detection:** Should we use external service or build in-house?
3. **Video Processing:** How to handle large video files efficiently?

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (This Sprint)
1. **Research Phase (Days 1-2):**
   - Document all external API capabilities and limitations
   - Create API access accounts and test basic connectivity
   - Finalize database schema based on API response structures

2. **Foundation Development (Days 3-5):**
   - Implement query classification with basic language detection
   - Set up database models and migrations
   - Create base agent architecture with proper interfaces

3. **Integration Setup (Days 6-7):**
   - Build API client framework with error handling
   - Implement caching layer with Redis
   - Create basic FastAPI endpoints for query processing

### Subsequent Sprint Recommendations
1. **Sprint 2:** Game Information Aggregation APIs (Weeks 3-4)
2. **Sprint 3:** Media Discovery and Review Aggregation (Week 5)
3. **Sprint 4:** Script Template System (Week 6)
