## Cross-Sprint Dependencies

### Critical Path
**Sprint 1 → Sprint 2:** Query classification must work before game research routing
**Sprint 2 → Sprint 3:** Game info services needed for script generation integration
**Sprint 3 → Sprint 4:** Both processing modes required before optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- 15% time buffer in each sprint
- Early API validation and fallback planning
- Incremental testing throughout development
- Performance monitoring from Sprint 1
