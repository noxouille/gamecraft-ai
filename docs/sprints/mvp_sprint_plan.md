# GameCraft AI MVP Sprint Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 20, 2025
**Planning Period:** 8 weeks (56 days)
**Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks each
**Total Sprints:** 4

---

## Important Terminology Clarification

This sprint plan distinguishes between two types of "agents":

1. **Claude Code Development Agents** - These are the specialized developers/engineers who will BUILD the GameCraft AI system during development (e.g., Backend Architecture Developer, ML/NLP Engineering Specialist, etc.)

2. **GameCraft AI Application Agents** - These are the AI agents that will BE PART OF the final web application (e.g., Game Information Agent, Video Analyzer Agent, Media Collector Agent, etc.)

Each sprint section clearly identifies:
- Which **Claude Code Development Agents** (developers) are needed to build the features
- Which **GameCraft AI Application Agents** will be implemented as part of the system

This distinction is crucial for understanding the development process versus the final product capabilities.

---

## Executive Summary

This sprint plan breaks down the GameCraft AI MVP into 4 two-week sprints, delivering a fully functional dual-mode AI system capable of both event coverage and game review script generation. Each sprint builds upon the previous one, ensuring incremental value delivery and risk mitigation.

1. **Unit Tests** - 85%+ code coverage for all core functionality
2. **Integration Tests** - Complete workflow validation for both modes
3. **Performance Tests** - Load testing with realistic usage patterns
4. **Quality Tests** - Content accuracy and user acceptance validation
5. **Security Tests** - Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
6. **User Acceptance Tests** - Testing with actual content creators

### Test Data & Scenarios
- **Event Test Data:** Sample gaming events, showcases, directs
- **Game Test Data:** Popular AAA games, indie games, upcoming releases
- **Language Test Data:** English and French queries across all formats
- **Edge Cases:** Long videos, obscure games, ambiguous queries
- **Stress Test Data:** Concurrent users, rate limit testing

## Risks & Final Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Final Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Performance targets not met | High | Low | Extensive optimization sprint, acceptable degradation thresholds |
| Quality issues discovered late | High | Medium | Early quality gates, iterative testing, stakeholder feedback loops |
| Integration issues in production | Medium | Medium | Staging environment testing, gradual rollout, rollback procedures |
| External API changes | Medium | Low | API versioning, multiple provider fallbacks, monitoring alerts |

# Cross-Sprint Dependencies & Risk Management

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Sprint 1 → Sprint 2
- Query classification system must be operational before game research can be properly routed
- Database schema must be complete before game information can be stored
- API client framework required for external service integration

### Sprint 2 → Sprint 3
- Game information services must be stable before script generation integration
- Media discovery must be working to provide content for script references
- Review aggregation needed for comprehensive game content scripts

### Sprint 3 → Sprint 4
- Both processing modes must be functional before optimization can begin
- Script generation quality must meet basic standards before fine-tuning
- All core features must be implemented before integration testing

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risk Management
1. **API Dependency Risk**
   - Early API access validation in Sprint 1
   - Backup data sources identified and prepared
   - Circuit breaker patterns implemented for resilience

2. **Performance Risk**
   - Performance benchmarking starts in Sprint 1
   - Incremental optimization throughout development
   - Load testing begins early in Sprint 3

3. **Quality Risk**
   - Quality gates defined and measured from Sprint 2
   - Continuous validation with domain experts
   - User feedback integration from Sprint 3

### Schedule Risk Management
1. **Timeline Buffers**
   - 15% time buffer built into each sprint
   - Critical path activities identified and prioritized
   - Scope adjustment protocols defined

2. **Resource Management**
   - Cross-training planned for critical knowledge areas
   - External expert consultation scheduled
   - Vendor relationships established for rapid scaling
